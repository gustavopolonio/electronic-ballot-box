# :book: About this Project

This is a project to improve my skills in basic concepts of Javascript, like arrays, objects, functions and DOM innerHTML property. This simulation of a elletronic
ballot box has static data, that's why you can vote for few candidates. You can vote in white (just click the white button), in valid candidates (see the valid 
numbers clicking on the buttons City councilor and Mayor on top) and in null (type a invalid number). 

This project is part of my personal portfolio, so I would appreciate if you provide me any feedback about the ideia, code, structure or anything you could report 
to make me a better developer.

Feel free to use the Electronic Ballot Box as you wish, either to study or make improvementes!
